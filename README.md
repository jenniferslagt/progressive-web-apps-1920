![Schermafbeelding 2020-03-30 om 15 18 42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45489420/77916707-c9d58d80-7299-11ea-903f-03540dac6ab6.png)

## Description
I made a server-side app in Node.js with the Express framework. I requested data from the Dark Sky API and rendered this on my pages via the EJS templates. The app is made for people who are looking for good surfspots in Europe, based on the weather. It shows the popular locations of surfspots and the corresponding weather at that moment! 

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a open source JavaScript environment for easily building fast and scalable network applications. It's a platform for excuting JavaScript code to the server-side. It also lets developers use JavaScript to write command lines (for the terminal). So you have a JavaScript file in the root of your directory (mine is called 'server.js') which excecutes the code to the server-side. 

### How to install Node.js?
If you want to install Node.js, you'll need NPM. You can prefer this as "Node Package Manager". This doesn't stand for NPM, but you can consider this as what NPM is and does. 
You can install node.js by follow the steps on this site: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
You can also control your latest version of npm or node by running: 
`node --v` or `npm --v`.

## What is Express?
Express is a popular framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for making applications.
- It's a fast framework for Node.js
- It's server-side (or back-end)
- It makes handling requests simple with less code

### How to install Express?
With node.js, you can install some packages via NPM. Express is one of those packages.
You can install Express via your Terminal by running:
`npm install express --save`

Then you can import it in your server JS file with require:
`var express = require("express");`

## Using the EJS template
I used the EJS (Embedded JavaScript Template) template to render the data on my pages. EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. I put the EJS files in the 'view' folder.

## The Dark Sky API
What is an API? Application programming interfaces (APIs) helps to make data available for extern users. In this way, you can request data to use it in different applications (like my page).
The Dark Sky API allows you to look up the weather anywhere on the globe, returning (where available).
